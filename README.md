# TCP-Server-Chat-Room
Developed a TCP server-based chat room that enabled multiple clients to interact with each other through the server. This chat room was equipped with several functionalities, including the ability for an Admin to ban or unban clients from the chat room.

Working on this project allowed me to gain exposure to several technologies, including Python, HTTP, and network programming. This experience further solidified my understanding of these technologies and their practical applications.
